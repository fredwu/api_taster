For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nif Rails.env.development?\r\n  ApiTaster.routes do\r\n    desc 'Get a __list__ of users'\r\n    get '/users'\r\n\r\n    post '/users', {\r\n      :user => {\r\n        :name => 'Fred'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    get '/users/:id', {\r\n      :id => 1\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    put '/users/:id', {\r\n      :id => 1, :user => {\r\n        :name => 'Awesome'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    delete '/users/:id', {\r\n      :id => 1\r\n    }\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Share Params with Test Factories\r\n\r\nIf you use a test factory such as [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl), you can require your test factories and share the params. For example in FactoryGirl you can use the `attributes_for(:name_of_factory)` method.\r\n\r\n### Global Params\r\n\r\nIf there are certain params (such as API version and auth token) that need to be present in every API endpoint, you may set them in `ApiTaster.global_params` before `ApiTaster.routes`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nApiTaster.global_params = {\r\n  :version    => 1,\r\n  :auth_token => 'teGpfbVitpnUwm7qStf9'\r\n}\r\n\r\nApiTaster.routes do\r\n  # your route definitions\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commenting API Endpoints\r\n\r\nBefore each route definitions, you may use `desc` to add some comments. Markdown is supported.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndesc 'Get a __list__ of users'\r\nget '/users'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Metadata for API Endpoints\r\n\r\nFor each route definition, you may supply an optional third parameter (hash) as metadata:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nget '/users', {}, { :meta => 'data' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe metadata option is useful for passing in arbitrary data for a route definition. For example, you could specify response expectations so that your test suite could tap into them.\r\n\r\nMetadata for every route definition are stored in `ApiTaster::Route.metadata`. Please read the source code to find out how to get metadata for a particular route.\r\n\r\n### Missing Route Definitions Detection\r\n\r\nInstead of manually finding out which route definitions you need, API Taster provides a warning page that shows you all the missing definitions.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/vZb93.png)\r\n\r\n### Obsolete / Mismatched Route Definitions Detection\r\n\r\nAPIs evolve - especially during the development stage. To keep `ApiTaster.routes` in sync with your route definitions, API Taster provides a warning page that shows you the definitions that are obsolete/mismatched therefore you could correct or remove them.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qK7g5.png)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis gem is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n[Fred Wu](https://github.com/fredwu), originally built for [Locomote](http://locomote.com.au).\r\n","name":"Api taster","google":"","tagline":"A quick and easy way to visually test your Rails application's API."}
